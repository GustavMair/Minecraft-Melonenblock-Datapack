# Minecraft-Melonenblock-Datapack
This Minecraft Datapack takes placce in a world that is just build out of Melons.
It's unfinished at this point. Feel free to use the code and finish it, or just use it as base code for another project, but please give Credit to me.
You need the Map, if you want the Datapack to work. The Datapack isn't installed in the map yet, so have to do that yourself. 
Some parts of the Codes, like dialoge, are in german. Localication isn't planned. 
It is unclear, if this Code will be developed by me in the future.
